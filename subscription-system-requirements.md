# 🎯 Subscription & Trial System - Complete Vision

## 📖 Overview

We need to implement a manual subscription system for the first 3-5 real users. This system will manage free trials, payment tracking, subscription status, and access control without automated payment gateway integration. Everything will be managed manually through WhatsApp payment coordination and admin dashboard controls.

---

## 🎯 Core Requirements

### **Business Goals**
- Give users 3 days free trial automatically on signup
- Collect payment manually via WhatsApp (personal bKash account)
- Track subscription status per workspace
- Block access when subscription expires
- Allow users to pause/resume bot without losing subscription
- Archive data for 30+ days if user doesn't renew (allow re-activation)
- Provide admin controls to manage all subscriptions manually

### **User Experience Goals**
- Simple subscription status visibility
- Clear payment instructions when expired
- Seamless bot toggle (pause/resume)
- No confusion between "bot paused" vs "subscription expired"
- Easy contact method for payment/support

---

## 🔄 Complete User Journey

### **Journey 1: New User (Happy Path)**

**Step 1: Signup**
- User creates account (email + password)
- System automatically creates workspace
- System automatically activates 3-day trial
- Trial end date = signup date + 3 days
- Subscription status = 'trial'

**Step 2: Using the App (Trial Period)**
- User connects Facebook page
- Adds products
- Bot starts working automatically
- Dashboard shows: "Trial: 2 days remaining"
- Everything works normally

**Step 3: Trial Ending (Day 3)**
- System sends notification: "Trial ends tomorrow. Contact us on WhatsApp to continue."
- WhatsApp number clearly displayed
- Bot continues working (grace until midnight)

**Step 4: Trial Expired**
- Trial period ends (3 days complete)
- Bot automatically stops working
- Subscription status = 'expired'
- User sees dashboard but cannot interact
- Every button/action shows toast: "Subscription expired. Contact us on WhatsApp: 01XXXXXXXXX to renew."
- WhatsApp button prominently displayed

**Step 5: Payment via WhatsApp**
- User contacts on WhatsApp
- Sends bKash payment screenshot
- Mentions workspace name/email

**Step 6: Admin Activation**
- Admin receives WhatsApp message
- Opens admin dashboard
- Finds the user's workspace
- Clicks "Activate Subscription"
- Selects plan (Starter/Pro/Business)
- Sets duration (1 month)
- Confirms activation

**Step 7: Reactivated**
- Subscription status = 'active'
- Expiry date = today + 30 days
- Bot resumes working immediately
- User dashboard shows: "Active - 30 days remaining"
- User can use all features

**Step 8: Monthly Renewal**
- 3 days before expiry, system sends reminder
- User pays via WhatsApp again
- Admin extends subscription from dashboard
- Cycle continues

---

### **Journey 2: User Wants to Pause Bot (Not Cancel)**

**Scenario:** User going on vacation, doesn't want bot to reply for 5 days, but subscription is active.

**Step 1: User Action**
- Goes to Settings page
- Sees "Bot Auto-Reply" toggle
- Turns it OFF
- Bot stops replying to customers

**Step 2: Subscription Still Active**
- Subscription status remains 'active'
- Days keep counting down
- Dashboard shows: "Bot paused by you. Subscription: 25 days left"
- User can turn bot ON anytime

**Important:** This is NOT cancellation. This is pause. Subscription continues.

---

### **Journey 3: User Doesn't Renew (Passive Cancellation)**

**Step 1: Subscription Expires**
- 30 days complete
- No payment received
- Status = 'expired'
- Bot stops working
- Hard block applied

**Step 2: Grace Period (30 Days)**
- Data remains in database (archived state)
- User can still login and see dashboard (read-only)
- Cannot use bot or any active features
- Toast message on every action: "Subscription expired. Renew to continue."

**Step 3: After 30 Days**
- If still no payment, data remains archived
- User can still reactivate by paying
- No automatic deletion

**Step 4: If User Returns (e.g., 2 months later)**
- User pays via WhatsApp
- Admin reactivates subscription
- All old data restored
- Bot works immediately
- No data loss

---

### **Journey 4: Admin Managing User**

**Scenario:** Admin needs to manually control a user's subscription.

**Admin Actions Available:**

1. **Activate Trial**
   - Select workspace
   - Click "Start Trial"
   - System sets trial_ends_at = +3 days

2. **Verify Payment & Activate**
   - Receive WhatsApp payment confirmation
   - Find workspace by name/email
   - Click "Activate Subscription"
   - Select plan (Starter ৳299 / Pro ৳599 / Business ৳1,299)
   - Set duration (default: 30 days, can customize)
   - Add payment note (e.g., "bKash TrxID: ABC123")
   - Confirm → Status changes to 'active', bot resumes

3. **Extend Subscription**
   - Find active subscription
   - Click "Extend"
   - Add days (default: 30, can customize)
   - New expiry date = old expiry + added days
   - Bot continues working

4. **Pause Subscription (Admin-initiated)**
   - Select workspace
   - Click "Pause"
   - Bot stops, but subscription time doesn't count down
   - Use case: User has issue, need to investigate

5. **Cancel Subscription**
   - Select workspace
   - Click "Cancel"
   - Status = 'cancelled'
   - Bot stops immediately
   - Data archived

6. **View Payment History**
   - See all payments for a workspace
   - Dates, amounts, notes, who activated

---

## 🗄️ Database Concepts (What We Need to Track)

### **Workspace Subscription Fields**

We need to add these fields to the `workspaces` table:

**Status Tracking:**
- subscription_status: Can be 'trial', 'active', 'expired', 'cancelled', 'paused'
- subscription_plan: 'starter', 'pro', 'business', 'enterprise'
- trial_ends_at: Timestamp when trial ends
- subscription_expires_at: Timestamp when paid subscription ends
- subscription_paused_at: If admin paused, when it was paused

**Payment Tracking:**
- last_payment_date: When last payment was received
- last_payment_amount: Amount paid (in BDT)
- last_payment_method: 'bkash', 'nagad', 'rocket', etc.
- total_paid: Cumulative amount paid (for lifetime value tracking)

**Configuration:**
- auto_renewal_reminder: Boolean (send reminder 3 days before expiry)
- payment_contact_method: 'whatsapp' (default)
- payment_contact_value: WhatsApp number to contact

### **Payment History Table**

Create a new table to track all payments:

**Fields Needed:**
- workspace_id: Which workspace paid
- amount: Payment amount in BDT
- payment_method: bkash/nagad/rocket
- payment_date: When payment was received
- payment_proof: URL to screenshot (optional)
- transaction_id: bKash TrxID or reference
- activated_by: Admin user who verified and activated
- plan_activated: Which plan was given
- duration_days: How many days added
- notes: Any admin notes
- created_at: Record creation timestamp

### **Bot Status vs Subscription Status**

Important distinction:

**facebook_pages.bot_enabled:**
- This is user-controlled toggle
- User can turn bot ON/OFF anytime
- Does NOT affect subscription status
- Just controls whether bot replies or not

**workspaces.subscription_status:**
- This is system/admin-controlled
- Determines overall access
- When 'expired', overrides bot_enabled
- Even if bot_enabled = true, if subscription expired, bot won't work

**Logic:**
```
Can bot reply?
IF subscription_status == 'active' OR subscription_status == 'trial':
  IF bot_enabled == true:
    YES, bot can reply
  ELSE:
    NO, user paused bot
ELSE:
  NO, subscription expired/cancelled
```

- Bot stops, time doesn't count down
- Can resume anytime

**Cancel:**
- Confirmation dialog: "This will stop the bot and archive the data. Continue?"
- Sets status = 'cancelled'
- Bot stops immediately
- Data archived (not deleted)

---

## ⚙️ System Logic & Rules

### **Rule 1: Automatic Trial Start**

**Trigger:** User completes signup and creates workspace

**Action:**
- Set subscription_status = 'trial'
- Set trial_ends_at = signup_timestamp + 3 days
- Set subscription_plan = null (no paid plan yet)
- Bot automatically enabled (bot_enabled = true)

---

### **Rule 2: Trial Expiry Check (Background Job)**

**Frequency:** Run every hour (or daily at midnight)

**Logic:**
```
For each workspace where subscription_status = 'trial':
  If current_time >= trial_ends_at:
    Set subscription_status = 'expired'
    Keep bot_enabled as is, but bot won't work due to expired status
    Send notification to user (optional)
    Log event in admin dashboard
```

---

### **Rule 3: Subscription Expiry Check (Background Job)**

**Frequency:** Run every hour (or daily at midnight)

**Logic:**
```
For each workspace where subscription_status = 'active':
  If current_time >= subscription_expires_at:
    Set subscription_status = 'expired'
    Bot stops working (even if bot_enabled = true)
    Send notification to user
    Log event in admin dashboard
```

---

### **Rule 4: Expiry Reminder (Background Job)**

**Frequency:** Run daily

**Logic:**
```
For each workspace where subscription_status = 'active':
  days_left = (subscription_expires_at - current_time) / 1 day
  
  If days_left == 3:
    Send reminder notification
    "Your subscription expires in 3 days. Renew now to avoid interruption."
    
  If days_left == 1:
    Send urgent reminder
    "Your subscription expires tomorrow! Contact us on WhatsApp: 01XXXXXXXXX"
```

---

### **Rule 5: Bot Reply Permission Check**

**Every time bot attempts to send a message:**

```
Check workspace subscription_status:

IF status == 'trial':
  IF trial_ends_at > current_time:
    Allow bot to reply ✅
  ELSE:
    Block bot, status should be 'expired' (background job will fix)
    
IF status == 'active':
  IF subscription_expires_at > current_time:
    Check bot_enabled:
      IF bot_enabled == true:
        Allow bot to reply ✅
      ELSE:
        Block bot (user paused it) ⏸️
  ELSE:
    Block bot, status should be 'expired' (background job will fix)
    
IF status == 'expired':
  Block bot ❌
  
IF status == 'cancelled':
  Block bot ❌

IF status == 'expired':
  Allow dashboard view (read-only) 👁️
  Show overlay warning
  Block all write actions
  Show toast on button clicks
  Display payment instructions
  
IF status == 'cancelled':
  Allow dashboard view (read-only) 👁️
  Show "Reactivate" call-to-action
  Block all features
```

```
Day 0 (Expiry):
  - Status = 'expired'
  - Data remains intact
  - User can view (read-only)
  
Day 1-30 (Grace Period):
  - Data still intact
  - User can reactivate anytime
  - All conversations, products, orders preserved
  
Day 30+ (Extended Grace):
  - Data STILL intact (archive forever)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After implementation, these should work perfectly:

### **User Perspective:**
✅ New signup → Trial starts automatically
✅ Trial status visible in dashboard
✅ Trial expires → Bot stops, clear payment instructions shown
✅ After payment → Bot resumes within 30 minutes
✅ Can pause/resume bot anytime (independent of subscription)
✅ Can see how many days left in subscription
✅ Clear communication about expiry
✅ Easy WhatsApp contact for payment/support

### **Admin Perspective:**
✅ See all users and their subscription status at a glance
✅ Can activate subscription in <1 minute after payment confirmation
✅ Can extend, pause, cancel subscriptions easily
✅ Can view payment history per user
✅ Can identify users near expiry (proactive outreach)
✅ Can see total revenue, active subscribers, churned users

### **System Perspective:**
✅ Background jobs run reliably (expiry checks, reminders)
✅ Bot respects subscription status (doesn't reply when expired)
✅ Dashboard enforces read-only mode when expired
✅ Data never lost (even after months of non-payment)
✅ Payment history tracked accurately
✅ No confusion between bot pause and subscription status

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### **What Code Editor Needs to Create:**

1. **Database Migration:**
   - Add subscription fields to workspaces table
   - Create payment_history table
   - Add indexes for performance

2. **API Routes:**
   - Admin: Activate subscription
   - Admin: Extend subscription
   - Admin: Pause/Cancel subscription
   - Admin: Get subscription details
   - Admin: Get payment history
   - User: Get own subscription status
   - User: Toggle bot enabled

3. **Background Jobs:**
   - Trial expiry checker (runs hourly)
   - Subscription expiry checker (runs hourly)
   - Reminder sender (runs daily)

4. **UI Components:**
   - Dynamic subscription card (sidebar)
   - Payment instructions modal
   - Expired state overlay
   - Admin subscription management page
   - Toast notifications for blocked actions

5. **Middleware/Logic:**
   - Bot reply permission checker
   - Dashboard access control
   - Read-only mode enforcement

6. **Notification System:**
   - In-app notifications
   - Email notifications (optional)
   - WhatsApp integration (future)

### **Priority Order:**

**Phase 1 (Must Have - Day 1):**
- Database schema
- Trial auto-start on signup
- Subscription status display
- Expired state blocking
- Admin activate/extend features

**Phase 2 (Should Have - Day 2):**
- Payment history tracking
- Background expiry jobs
- Reminder notifications
- Payment instructions UI
- Admin user list with filters

**Phase 3 (Nice to Have - Day 3):**
- Email notifications
- Analytics (revenue, churn)
- Bulk operations
- Export payment history

## 🚀 Final Vision

After this system is live:

**For Users:**
- Smooth onboarding with free trial
- Clear pricing and payment process
- No confusion about status
- Easy renewal process
- Flexible bot control

**For Admin (You):**
- Full control over all subscriptions
- Quick payment verification and activation
- Clear visibility into revenue and active users
- Easy to identify users needing attention
- Manual but efficient workflow

**For Business:**
- Validate product-market fit with first users
- Collect real payment before automating
- Build trust with personal WhatsApp support
- Gather feedback for future improvements
- Scale when ready with automated system

This manual system is perfect for MVP phase with 3-5 users. Once you have 20+ users, you can automate with bKash Merchant API, but for now, this gives you full control and close customer relationships.
